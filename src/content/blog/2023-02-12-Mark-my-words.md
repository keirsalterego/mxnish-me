It seems that I always spend a lot of time on building my homepage.
My first homepage (or blog) was built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) in 2021.
Yeah, it took me so much time to develop my own blog themes that I almost forgot about writing the blog lol.

These days, again, I turned to another new homepage, which I hope is the last one (before I begin to be fed up with it again in about 1-2 years).

## Style

I want my homepage to be more "research" and "serious". 

I don't want to modify my blog theme directly since I still love its style and it already has a certain number of users. Thus I wrote a new one.

## Tech stack

Gradually I found I got so caught up with atomic CSS frameworks like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [UnoCSS](https://github.com/antfu/unocss). I'm using UnoCSS in almost all of my recent projects and I can say that I never want to write semantic class names and regular CSS anymore, but it sounds a heavy work and I'm not sure if it is a right choice. But starting a new site with UnoCSS could be much eaiser - that's what I'm doing.

Anyway, this is site is still WIP, hoping to see what it will eventually become.
