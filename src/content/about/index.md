## $ nvim bio.txt

I’m a B.Tech student in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://silicon.ac.in/bbsr-home/b-tech-computer-science-engineering/) at [Silicon University](https://silicon.ac.in/), moving beyond the application layer to engineer the machinery that powers the decentralized web.

While most developers focus on writing smart contracts, I focus on what runs them. My passion lies in **Core Protocol Engineering** and **Systems Programming** using **Rust**. I am currently researching the **Solana Runtime (SVM)**, validator architecture, and high-performance network infrastructure.

Instead of building UI/UX, I am obsessed with low-level optimizations, memory safety, and the consensus mechanisms that make blockchains scalable. My goal is to work on the "metal" of Web3—contributing to open-source validator clients and optimizing transaction processing at the system level.

Check out my [repositories](/projects) where I explore systems-level challenges and Rust performance.

Always compiling, always optimizing.
