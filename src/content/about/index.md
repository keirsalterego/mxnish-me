## Bio

<!-- I am a B.Tech student in the [Computer Science and Engineering](https://silicon.ac.in/bbsr-home/b-tech-computer-science-engineering/) department at [Silicon University](https://silicon.ac.in/). My current interest leans in WEB3 development.

By the way, take a look at [some things](/projects) I've built as a web developer. -->

I’m a B.Tech student in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://silicon.ac.in/bbsr-home/b-tech-computer-science-engineering/) at [Silicon University](https://silicon.ac.in/), where I’m exploring the future of the web-one block at a time. My current passion? Building the next wave of decentralized applications and diving deep into the world of Web3.

When I’m not decoding smart contracts or tinkering with blockchain tech, you’ll find me crafting sleek, user-friendly web projects. My main focus is on web development—designing and building modern, performant, and accessible websites and apps that make a difference.

Curious about what I’ve built? Check out [some things](/projects) I’ve launched as a web developer.

Always learning, always building-on-chain and beyond.
