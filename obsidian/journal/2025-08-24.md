# Test Journal Entry

This is a test entry to verify that the Obsidian journal integration is working correctly.

## What I'm Testing
- Automatic file watching
- Frontmatter parsing
- Content synchronization
- Git commit and push

## Next Steps
- [x] Verify the entry appears on the website
- [x] Check if the changes are committed to Git
- [x] Ensure the website updates automatically

*"The first step towards getting somewhere is to decide that you are not going to stay where you are."*
