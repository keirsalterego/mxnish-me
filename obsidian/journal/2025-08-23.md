it felt good to wake this morning without the blare of the weekday alarm. The monsoon clouds have kept things cool in Cuttack, and the sound of drizzling rain from my window was the perfect start for the weekend.

After that lazy ghee-loaded breakfast and a strong cup of chai, I decided to be a bit productive. I spent a good few hours diving back into that JavaScript book I've recommended to most of my juniors who've asked about JavaScript development. It's been a while since I spent time refining my JavaScript skills, especially for backend work. This project has humbled me enough to return to my basic roots and start everything from scratch as a revision.

That also got me thinking about the project’s future. I found myself going down to a rabbit hole thinking about discussion I had with GNOME’s maintainer. It’s an ambitious thought turning noxy into a native GNOME app or maybe even getting it accepted into the GNOME Circle, feels really an exciting ;png-term goal. I’m happy for atleast what I’m thinking about building can get integrated so cleanly with the desktop environment i use everyday. It’ll be a challenge that feels worth tackling. Good night Keir.!
